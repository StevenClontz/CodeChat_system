conf.py - Template configuration file for a Sphinx CodeChat project
This file configures Sphinx, which transforms restructured text (reST) into html. See Sphinx build configuration file docs for more information on the settings below.

This file was originally created by sphinx-quickstart, then modified by hand. Notes on its operation:

This file is execfile()d by Sphinx with the current directory set to its containing dir.

Not all possible configuration values are present in this autogenerated file.

All configuration values have a default; values that are commented out serve to show the default.

import sys, os
import CodeChat.CodeToRest
 
If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory, add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, as shown here.

##sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
Project information
project and copyright: General information about the project. Change this for your project.

project = "Project Name"
copyright = "2020, Author"
 
The version info for the project you’re documenting, acts as replacement for |version| and |release|, also used in various other places throughout the built documents. Change these for your project.

version: The short X.Y version.

version = "0.0"
release: The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.

release = "version 0.0"
 
There are two options for replacing |today|:

1. If you set today to some non-false value, then it is used:

##today = ''
2. Otherwise, today_fmt is used as the format for a strftime call.

##today_fmt = '%B %d, %Y'
 
highlight_language: The default language to highlight source code in.

highlight_language = "python3"
 
pygments_style: The style name to use for Pygments highlighting of source code.

pygments_style = "sphinx"
 
add_function_parentheses: If true, ‘()’ will be appended to :func: etc. cross-reference text.

##add_function_parentheses = True
 
add_module_names: If true, the current module name will be prepended to all description unit titles (such as .. function::).

##add_module_names = True
 
show_authors: If true, sectionauthor and moduleauthor directives will be shown in the output. They are ignored by default.

##show_authors = False
 
modindex_common_prefix: A list of ignored prefixes for module index sorting.

##modindex_common_prefix = []
 
General configuration
extensions: If your documentation needs a minimal Sphinx version, state it here.

##needs_sphinx = '1.5'
 
Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be extensions coming with Sphinx (named ‘sphinx.ext.*’) or your custom ones. CodeChat note: The CodeChat.CodeToRestSphinx extension is mandatory; without it, CodeChat will not translate source code to reST and then (via Sphinx) to html.

extensions = ["CodeChat.CodeToRestSphinx"]
 
templates_path: Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

templates_path = ["_templates"]
 
rst_epilog: A string of reStructuredText that will be included at the end of every source file that is read.

rst_epilog = (
Provide a convenient way to refer to a source file’s name.

    """

.. |docname| replace:: :docname:`name`
"""
)
 
source_suffix: The suffix of source filenames.

source_suffix = ".rst"
 
CodeChat note: CodeChat_lexer_for_glob is a dict of {glob, lexer_alias}, which uses lexer_alias (e.g. a lexer’s short name) to analyze any file which matches the given glob-style pattern (e.g. glob).

CodeChat_lexer_for_glob = {
The codechat_config.json file uses # for comments; so does Python.

    "codechat_config.json": "Python",
}
 
source_encoding: The encoding of source files.

##source_encoding = 'utf-8-sig'
 
master_doc: The master toctree document.

master_doc = "index"
 
language: The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation for a list of supported languages.

##language = None
 
exclude_patterns: List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and directories to ignore when looking for source files.

Important: Do NOT add CodeChat.css to this list; this will instruct Sphinx not to copy it to the _static directory, where it is needed to properly lay out CodeChat output.

exclude_patterns = [
Misc files.

    "Thumbs.db",
    ".DS_Store",
CodeChat notes:

By default, the CodeChat System will instruct Sphinx to place all Sphinx output in``_build``; this directory should therefore be excluded from the list of source files.

    "_build",
]
 
default_role: The reST default role (used for this markup: `text`) to use for all documents.

default_role = "any"
 
keep_warnings: If true, keep warnings as “system message” paragraphs in the built documents. Regardless of this setting, warnings are always written to the standard error stream when sphinx-build is run. CodeChat note: This should always be True; doing so places warnings next to the offending text in the web view, making them easy to find and fix.

keep_warnings = True
Options for HTML output
html_theme: The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.

html_theme = "default"
 
html_theme_options: Theme options are theme-specific and customize the look and feel of a theme further.

##html_theme_options = {}
 
html_style: The style sheet to use for HTML pages.

##html_style = None
 
html_theme_path: Add any paths that contain custom themes here, relative to this directory.

##html_theme_path = []
 
html_title: The name for this set of Sphinx documents. If None, it defaults to <project> v<release> documentation.

##html_title = None
 
html_short_title: A shorter title for the navigation bar. Default is the same as html_title.

##html_short_title = None
 
html_logo: The name of an image file (relative to this directory) to place at the top of the sidebar.

##html_logo = None
 
html_favicon: The name of an image file (within the static path) to use as favicon of the docs. This file should be a Windows icon file (.ico) being 16x16 or 32x32 pixels large.

##html_favicon = None
 
html_static_path: Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here, relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files, so a file named default.css will overwrite the builtin default.css. CodeChat note: Include the path to CodeChat’s static files.

html_static_path = CodeChat.CodeToRest.html_static_path()
 
html_last_updated_fmt: If not ‘’, a ‘Last updated on:’ timestamp is inserted at every page bottom, using the given strftime format.

html_last_updated_fmt = "%b, %d, %Y"
 
html_sidebars: Custom sidebar templates, maps document names to template names.

##html_sidebars = {}
 
html_additional_pages: Additional templates that should be rendered to pages, maps page names to template names.

##html_additional_pages = {}
 
html_domain_indices: If false, no module index is generated.

##html_domain_indices = True
 
html_use_index: If false, no index is generated.

##html_use_index = True
 
html_split_index: If true, the index is split into individual pages for each letter.

##html_split_index = False
 
html_copy_source: If true, the reST sources are included in the HTML build as _sources/name.

html_copy_source = True
 
html_show_sourcelink: If true, links to the reST sources are added to the pages.

html_show_sourcelink = True
 
html_sourcelink_suffix: Suffix to be appended to source links (see html_show_sourcelink), unless they have this suffix already.

html_sourcelink_suffix = ""
 
html_show_sphinx: If true, “Created using Sphinx” is shown in the HTML footer. Default is True.

##html_show_sphinx = True
 
html_show_copyright: If true, “(C) Copyright …” is shown in the HTML footer. Default is True.

##html_show_copyright = True
 
html_use_opensearch: If true, an OpenSearch description file will be output, and all pages will contain a <link> tag referring to it. The value of this option must be the base URL from which the finished HTML is served.

##html_use_opensearch = ''
 
html_file_suffix: This is the file name suffix for HTML files (e.g. “.xhtml”).

##html_file_suffix = None
